      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by [Prof. Julia Vogt (ETH)](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/) and [Prof. Bernhard SchÃ¶lkopf (MPI)](https://ei.is.mpg.de/). My current research focuses on solving problems on **interpretability** of machine learning methods, as well as on the development of **generative models** and gaining a better understanding and control of them (diffusion, VAEs, LLMs) through their **representations**. In parallel, I am working on the development of foundation models as part of the [Swiss AI initiative](https://www.swiss-ai.org/) to better understand VLMs and exploit their capabilities in real-world clinical applications. 

I am currently a visiting student at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) with [Prof. Mihaela Van der Shaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/) working on alignment and interpretability of LLMs. During my PhD, I have been a Research Intern and a Student Researcher at Google, developing 3D diffusion-based generative models in the [AR&VR team](https://arvr.google.com/), and I am the team co-leader of [CSNOW](https://csnow.inf.ethz.ch/), Computer Science Network of Women at ETH. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), and spent a semester at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) working on 3D generative models for super-resolution of MR images. I was lucky to be supported by two Spanish Excellence Fellowships, [La Caixa](https://becarios.fundacionlacaixa.org/en/sonia-laguna-cillero-B005184) and [Rafel del Pino](https://bfrdelpino.com/). Before that, I completed my BSc in Biomedical Engineering at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home), spent one year at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), and carried out an internship at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) as an [Amgen Scholar](https://amgenscholars.com/). 

I am always happy to collaborate and discuss new topics, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’¡
