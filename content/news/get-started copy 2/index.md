In [Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13544), we fine-tune black box models such that they become intervenable, while in [Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19272), we model the dependencies of concepts to improve the effect of interventions.
